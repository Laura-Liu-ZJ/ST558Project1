# Outline

To study the NHL data, I get the 5 JSON data sets from API. And
reorganize those data sets by selecting some variables, creating some
variables, and combining relevant data sets. In this project, I picked
out the “best” franchise and the “worst” franchise according to the EDA
part for teamtotalData and seasonData. Then I also tried EDA on the
differences between the “best” franchise and the “worst” franchise from
goalieData and skaterData. The results show that the “best” franchise is
Golden Knights (ID: 38) and the “worst” franchise is Coyotes (ID: 28),
which might because of the number of goalie and skater, the goalies’
ability of resistance and the skaters’ aggressive assists.

# Discussion on this project

## what would you do differently?

  - I get data from the API.
  - I use the EDA part to know the data better.
  - I create some variables to help my analysis.
  - I treat the same variable as categorical data and numeric data.

## what was the most difficult part for you?

I think the most difficult part for me is to understand the story behind
the data because I know nothing on the hokey. It would be better to have
a codebook or labels of variables telling me all the information about
data.

## what are your big take-aways from this project?

I know better about JSON data as well as EDA procession, and I master
better on ggplot than before.
